# Telegram UserIDs and their Checksums

These are sha1 checksums about the Telegram UserID (@something) of our Qwertycoin verified members.

To verify that your chat partner is an official team member, copy their user name(s), convert it to [sha1](http://www.sha1-online.com/) and compare the checksums.
If there is a discrepancy, it is a scam
